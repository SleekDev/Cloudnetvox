                 Mail may not be used to harass or intimidate others. Harassment, whether through language,
                  frequency of messages, or size of messages, is prohibited. Sending a single unwelcome message may 
                  be considered harassment. If a recipient asks to stop receiving e-mail, YOU must not send that person 
                  any further messages. NOTE - If YOU use the services of another provider to promote a website hosted by or 
                  through CloudNetvox ("spamvertising"), then the provisions of the above policy shall apply as if the SPAM 
                  were sent through our servers. </span>
